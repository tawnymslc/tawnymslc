Hi Everyone. Thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ At my portfolio site, tawny-mathi.com, I have integrated Unstoppable Domain's Partner API and Stripe's Payment API. It's a React App built on the front end with Node.js server on the back end. I have since added a Spotify integration where users can search for their favorite artist top tracks, albums, and info. It's also built with React and Nodejs. 
- ðŸ’»  My most recent role was an integration engineer at Unstoppable Domains. I supported integration development with dApps partnering with Unstoppable. I also completed integrations (pull requests) for clients. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning typescript. I recently graduated Nucamp's Full-Stack Bootcamp. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite city, Tokyo! I just got back from my 4th trip. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tawnymslc@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm certified as a group fitness instructor. I'm certified in 2 formats, werkit and phunk fit.
